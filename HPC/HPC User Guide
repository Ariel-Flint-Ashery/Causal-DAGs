For a Windows machine, first download the PuTTY program.
Throughout, remove '' when pasting.
How to login:
1. Using PuTTy, specify the host as 'login.hpc.imperial.ac.uk' and select 'open'.
2. log in using your specified Imperial shortcode/username

Setting up Python environment: #do this every time you want to run Python code
1. 'module load anaconda3/personal' #load anaconda
2. 'conda create -n py39 python=3.9' #create python virtual environment. You only need to run this once!
3. 'source activate py39' #activate virtual environment. 

Running code:
Once you login onto the HPC, you will be in your main directory, '$HOME' (will show up as '~'). You can access the list of all available directory by typing 'ls'. 
To enter a directory, type 'cd dir'. Once you are in the designated directory, you can run your code by typing 'python3 filename.py' <-- Make sure you set up the conda environment first!

How to upload files (using scp):
1. On your local machine, go to the file where the directory/file you want to copy exists, and enter the command prompt
2a. If you want to copy a directory: 'scp -r 'dirname' shortcode@login.hpc.imperial.ac.uk:X', where X is the target directory. Use '$HOME' or '~' for home directory.
2b. To copy one file: 'scp 'filename' shortcode@login.hpc.imperial.ac.uk:X', where X is the target directory.

Moving files from HPC to local machine:
1. Open cmd in the directory where you want to save the file
2. Type 'scp shortcode@login.hpc.imperial.ac.uk:X .' , where X is the filepath in the remote machine e.g. X = '$HOME\filename.txt'. '.' places the files in the current directory in the local machine.
3. To move directories, use the same process as above, but use '-r'.

Submitting jobs:
Use the template testscript.sh to build the job script. 
Output should be saved in the working directory, and an additional log file (jobscript.sh.oXXXXX) will be created (all prints will go in this file).
1. To run: 'qsub jobscript.sh'
2. To check status: 'qstat'
